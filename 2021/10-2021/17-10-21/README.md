## Reflection

Nice. Learned about yield and writing ruby methods and writing ruby class methods on core library classes. very slick.

Also learned we need to implement bang methods custom... no magic to implement `.map!` from a written `.map`

Also learned about `.dup` method for duplicating ruby objects. It works on arrays (at least). And used the `block_given?` helper to stave off errors.
