## Reflection

Not the most exciting of code studies or sessions, but i made it a bit through the resource and should have a fun starting point tomorrow.

Tomorrow work on this resource https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/the-enumerable-module from this paragraph :

> You'll have noticed earlier that we could call most Enumerable methods two ways, by either passing a block of code or a symbol. We don't have that functionality yet, so let's implement it. We will accomplish this by using the send method to dynamically dispatch a method call.
