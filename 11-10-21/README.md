## Reflection

finished this fairly easily

- made a mistake where after splitting `string.split(' ')` i didn't select the first element becore calling a string method `string.split(' ').downcase` instead of `string.split(' ')[0].downcase` so i got a no method error
- made a typo, variable names didn't match, so got an `undefined local variable or method` error

compared to the 'official solution', my solution is definitely i think less clean.
the 'official solution' avoids any kind of finniky array splitting or string manipulation like my solution does.
