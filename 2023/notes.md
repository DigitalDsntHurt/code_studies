## accomplished 
- learned to use browserify to import node and yarn modules into .js files using `require('name_of_node_module');` syntax like in node.js

## follow-ups & questions
- would this work the same with typescript?
- alternative approaches
    - webpack
    - vite
    - CDN
    - actual node
        - what are the other approaches?
        - what are the tradeoffs of each?
        - i'd like to practice using each
        - i'd like to understand in more depth the costs and benefits of each approach
