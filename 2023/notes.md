## ideas
.[] create a bash automation which copies text from a file into another file
..[] use this for copying html_template content

## accomplished
- used browserify to import xdate into a .js file
- used xdate to write methods
    - calculate birth monday
    - calculate death sunday
    - incomplete life compilation method
- stumbled into using recursive functions, which was fun
## follow-ups and questions
- mental fuzziness over how mutable vs immutable my date objects are
-- .[] what excercise / deliberate practice can i do to resolve this misunderstanding permanently?

## next things to try
- .[] hard-code a small array of arrays where each inner array is a week (an array containing 7 date object) and draw a grid of shapes onto the canvas to visualize
    - .[] svg
    - .[] observable's plot
    - .[] d3

## accomplished 
- learned to use browserify to import node and yarn modules into .js files using `require('name_of_node_module');` syntax like in node.js

## follow-ups & questions
- would this work the same with typescript?
- alternative approaches
    - webpack
    - vite
    - CDN
    - actual node
        - what are the other approaches?
        - what are the tradeoffs of each?
        - i'd like to practice using each
        - i'd like to understand in more depth the costs and benefits of each approach
