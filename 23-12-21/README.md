# Code Study - /date

## Tool

ruby

## Task

calculate monthly and total car loan payments

## Purpose

understand apr

## Timebox

60mins

## Reflection

still have not nailed this. this, i think, is a case of under researching. i'd like to spend another 90 minutes on this:

- 45 mins reading about how apr works and how monthly payment calculations work
- 45 mins coding

desired outcome: given principal, loan duration, apr

- calculate total amount paid over duration of loan
- calculate monthly payment
- print a table with columns
- month num
- principal payment
- interest payment
- total monthly payment
