# Code Study - /date

## Tool

ruby

## Task

write encryption and decryption functions using the following schemes

- rotation (in-word)
- rotation (alphabetical)
- transposition

## Purpose

understand encryption and actively learn from the `how software works book` i'm reading

## Timebox

60 mins

## Reflection

i found the most basic part of this exercise difficult. that's allright, just keep going.
i do think i could be even more rigorous about my approach to this, specifically...

- write out the IOCE everytime
- come up with different solutions
- weight tradeoffs between solutions
- fully pseudocode the solution you choose to go with before writing actual code
